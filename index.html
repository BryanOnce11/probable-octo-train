  <h2>Port Barton</h2>
  <p>
    Port Barton is perfectly situated, close to a number of sand bars, small islands and coral reefs, meaning it offers wonderful day trips. What Are My 3 Favourite Things To Do In Port Barton: Swimming with turtles, Getting amazing coffee at Milano Cafe and Enjoying a sunset meal on the beach.

  <h2>Bandian, Cebu</h2>
  <p>
  Badian, Cebu
Though Badian is small, it is one of the best cities to visit in The Philippines and is well situated close to a number of the best things to see and do on Cebu.

In particular, a whole string of incredible waterfalls, with the pinnacle being Kawasan Falls.

These are some of the nicest falls anywhere in The Philippines and truly are Instagram-worthy with their pure blue pool at the base.

However, all around the area you’ll find other lovely waterfalls and the most popular tours here are canyoneering tours where a guide takes you further and further down through a string of waterfalls and allows you to climb and jump in a number of them.

  <h2>Bohol</h2>
  <p>
  This fairly large island needs at least a few days spent there if you wish to get out of the main touristy area of Panglao.

Here, inland you will discover a strange phenomenon known as the Chocolate Hills.

Literally hundreds of large brown hills that cover the landscape in all directions.

As well as this, you have all the other things you’ve come to know and love in the Philippines, including white sandy beaches, hidden waterfalls, rice terraces, gorgeous rivers and day trips to other islands.

You also have the chance to see dolphins, swim in cave pools, have lunch sailing down Loboc River and possibly even swim with sardines!

  <h2>Coron</h2>
  <p>
Compared to El Nido, Coron is still relatively new, despite being just a short ferry ride around.

Perhaps it was because we stayed on Paolyn Houseboats (more on that below), but I really fell in love with Coron.

It is home to a number of beautiful snorkelling spots and lakes, with nearby Kayangan Lake supposedly the clearest and cleanest of any lake in the world.

To visit these, you go on a day long island hopping tour (like this one).

During the middle of the day, a number of these spots get very busy, so it’s good to go on a tour that leaves early and allows you to escape the hordes

  <h2>El Nido</h2>
  <p>
  El Nido has been a popular place to visit in the Philippines for a long time, perhaps the MOST popular tourist spot in The Philippines.

For this reason you’ll discover a well developed tourist industry, with the main attraction being a selection of day long island hopping tours (like this one).

You have the chance to sail deep into the ocean, discovering snorkel points, wide canyons and truly breathtaking surroundings.

In the port, there are literally dozens of boats that go out every day and tours are all still relatively cheap.

  <h2>Siquijor</h2>
  <p>
  Siquijor
Siquijor is the furthest south of theses places to visit in the Philippines and a destination that you really can’t miss!

It is a relatively small island, meaning you can drive it and see many of Siquijor’s best attractions in less than a day.
Which is perfect, as it gives you plenty of time to slow down, relax and enjoy the stunning beaches.

Many people who visit go snorkeling and diving off the coast, however, by far the best attraction in Siquijor is Cambugahay Falls.

These are now my favorite waterfalls from anywhere in the world, and are a series of beautiful milky blue pools in sequence.
